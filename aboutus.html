    <h2>About Us</h2>

    <p>
        MacGregor's Gems is a family-owned legacy built across generations of passionate geologists
        and skilled gemologists from South Africa and Ireland. Our roots blend the rich mineral
        heritage of Southern Africa with the traditional craftsmanship and precision that Ireland is
        known for.
    </p>

    <p>
        For decades, our family has explored, collected, and studied some of the most remarkable
        stones on Earth — transforming raw natural beauty into pieces admired for their purity,
        brilliance, and authenticity.
    </p>

    <p>
        Every gemstone we curate reflects the dedication of our ancestors, who believed that
        stones are more than minerals: they are stories, memories, and connections between people
        and the natural world.
    </p>

    <p>
        Today, we continue this heritage with respect, expertise, and a deep love for the craft —
        offering carefully selected semi-precious gems to collectors, artisans, and gemstone enthusiasts
        around the globe.
